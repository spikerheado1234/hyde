Some of the software engineering internships I have partaken in.

## Citadel 

I am currently here this summer!

## Google

During my time at google, I worked on the Mojaloop Project. A project that aims to increase financial inclusion in lower economically developed countries. I contributed in the following ways:

* Designed Asynchronous Web APIs via OpenAPI for authorisation microservice as well as database schemas for
authorisation microservice for the MojaLoop Project. Implemented all APIs in HapiJS and TypeScript.
* Built Infrastructural groundwork to enable integration testing with databases.
* All the code has been merged into production. In subsequent builds, third party payment applications (e.g. Venmo, UPI) will be
interoperable to the larger MojaLoop network in a secure manner.

## Ninja-Van

During my time at Ninja-Van, I worked with the platforms team, an infrastructure team that builds internal tools to increase productivity. I contributed in the following ways:

* Developed a full stack Chrome application using JavaScript and WebUSB to route print requests to a Label Printer, with a 150-180% speedup.
* Developed a system to visualise Kafka and internal system metrics with Slack alerts using Grafana, InfluxDB and Prometheus.
* Integrated Highly Structured Message logic into a WhatsApp microservice replacing a pay-per-messaging service model, saving 12k$ annually.
