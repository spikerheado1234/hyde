<p class="message">
I am Ahan Gupta, a computer science senior at the National University of Singapore! I am an avid researcher and software engineer, with the hope of working on <strong> hard </strong> problems through the stack: from their abstract & theoretical viewpoints down to their implementations and real world use.

A rather short and pithy vita can be found [here](./public/Resume.pdf).

And a nice timeline of my experience for the folks who like colorful images.
